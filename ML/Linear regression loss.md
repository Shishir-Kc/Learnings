**Loss** is a numeric metric that describes how wrong a model's **predictions** are. Loss measure distance between model's prediction and the actual labels . The goal of the training is to minimize the loss , reducing it to its lowest possible value.

In the following image, you can visualize loss as arrows drawn from the data points to the model. The arrows show how far the model's predictions are from the actual values.

**Figure 8**. Loss is measured from the actual value to the predicted value.

## Distance of loss

In ML and Statics , loss measures the distance between actual value and the predicted value rigardless of it's direction .  Suppose a model predicted 2 but the actual value was 5 (2 - 5 = -3 ) , calculating loss does-not depend on direction it solely depends on the measurement of its numeric value .

> how do we get loss but not it's direction ?
	The two most common methods to remove the sign are the following:
 - Take the absolute value of the difference between the actual value and the prediction.
 - Square the difference between the actual value and the prediction.

## Types of loss

In linear regression, there are 5 main types of loss.


| Loss Type                     | Defination                                                                            | Equation                                                                       |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| $L_1$ loss                    | The sum of the absolute values of the difference between actual and predicted values. | $\sum \|\textit{actual value} - \textit{predicted value}\|$                    |
| Mean absolute error (MAE)     | The average of $L_1$ across a set N number of examples                                | $\frac{1}{N} \sum \|\textit{actual value} - \textit{predicted value}\|$        |
| $L_2$ loss                    | The sum of the squared defference between actual and predicted values.                | $\sum (\textit{actual value} - \textit{predicted value})^2$                    |
| Mean square error (Mse)       | The average of $L_2$ across a set N number of examples.                               | $\frac{1}{n} \sum (\textit{actual value} - \textit{predicted value})^2$        |
| Root mean square error (RMSE) | The square root of the Mean square error                                              | $\sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum (\textit{actual value} - \textit{predicted value})^2}$ |
The functional difference between L1 loss and L2 loss (or between MAE/RMSE and MSE) is squaring. When the difference between the prediction and label is large, squaring makes the loss even larger. When the difference is small (less than 1), squaring makes the loss even smaller.

Loss metrics like MAE and RMSE may be preferable to L2 loss or MSE in some use cases because they tend to be more human-interpretable, as they measure error using the same scale as the model's predicted value.

**Note:** MAE and RMSE can differ quite widely. MAE represents the average prediction error, whereas RMSE represents the "spread" of the errors, and is more skewed by larger errors.

When processing multiple examples at once, we recommend averaging the losses across all the examples, whether using MAE, MSE, or RMSE.

## Calculating loss example

In the previous section, we created the following [model](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/linear-regression#linear_regression_equation) to predict fuel efficiency based on car heaviness:

- Model:
    - Weight:
    - Bias:

If the model predicts that a 2,370-pound car gets 23.1 miles per gallon, but it actually gets 24 miles per gallon, we would calculate the L2 loss as follows:

**Note:** The formula uses 2.37 because the graphs are scaled to 1000s of pounds.

|Value|Equation|Result|
|---|---|---|
|Prediction|||
|Actual value|||
|L2 loss|||

In this example, the L2 loss for that single data point is 0.81.

## Choosing a loss

Deciding whether to use MAE or MSE can depend on the dataset and the way you want to handle certain predictions. Most feature values in a dataset typically fall within a distinct range. For example, cars are normally between 2000 and 5000 pounds and get between 8 to 50 miles per gallon. An 8,000-pound car, or a car that gets 100 miles per gallon, is outside the typical range and would be considered an [**outlier**](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary#outliers).

An outlier can also refer to how far off a model's predictions are from the real values. For instance, 3,000 pounds is within the typical car-weight range, and 40 miles per gallon is within the typical fuel-efficiency range. However, a 3,000-pound car that gets 40 miles per gallon would be an outlier in terms of the model's prediction because the model would predict that a 3,000-pound car would get around 20 miles per gallon.

When choosing the best loss function, consider how you want the model to treat outliers. For instance, MSE moves the model more toward the outliers, while MAE doesn't. L2 loss incurs a much higher penalty for an outlier than L1 loss. For example, the following images show a model trained using MAE and a model trained using MSE. The red line represents a fully trained model that will be used to make predictions. The outliers are closer to the model trained with MSE than to the model trained with MAE.

![Figure 9. The model is tilted more toward the outliers.](https://developers.google.com/static/machine-learning/crash-course/linear-regression/images/model-mse.png)

**Figure 9**. MSE loss moves the model closer to the outliers.

![Figure 10. The model is tilted further away from the outliers.](https://developers.google.com/static/machine-learning/crash-course/linear-regression/images/model-mae.png)

**Figure 10**. MAE loss keeps the model farther from the outliers.

Note the relationship between the model and the data:

- **MSE**. The model is closer to the outliers but further away from most of the other data points.
    
- **MAE**. The model is further away from the outliers but closer to most of the other data points.

**Choose MSE:**

- If you want to heavily penalize large errors.
- If you believe the outliers are important and indicative of true data variance that the model should account for.

**Note:** The mathematical properties of MSE often make optimization smoother. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is often used to get the error back into the same units as the label.

**Choose MAE:**

- If your dataset has significant outliers that you don't want to overly influence the model. MAE is more robust.
- If you prefer a loss function that is more directly interpretable as the average error magnitude.

In practice, your metric choice can also depend on the specific business problem and what kind of errors are more costly.
